# PlutoTuari

A standalone alternative for the [Pluto Desktop][pluto-desktop-link] using [Tauri][tauri-app]

## Reasons

- Tauri builds smaller and faster web apps
- Built with Rust, a very popular language and fun to learn
- For myself. I want to learn

## Downsides

- Julia cannot compile to binary yet, hence, we still need Julia to be installed
- As for the previous point, Pluto.jl still needs to be installed
